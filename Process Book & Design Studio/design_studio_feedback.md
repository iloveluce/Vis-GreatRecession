General Questions

	Are the objectives interesting to the target audience?
		Yes, with the target audience being Americans interested in the Economy. 
		We are displaying several different interesting indicators of the US
		and by state -- it is near impossible to find a multi-dataset 
		visualization of the US. We have a niche.

	Is the scope of the project appropriate? If not, suggest improvements.
		The scope of the project is reasonable, given the breadth of the 
		visualizations suggested. A possible scope adjustment is to add
		five maps with each one linked up to an indicator.

	Is the split between optional and must-have features appropriate? Why?
		The original split did not seem to contain enough functionality regarding
		the first deadline. But the revised schedule seemed ambitious, a good 
		thing

	Is the visualization innovative? Creative? Why?
		The individual visualizations themselves are not necessarily creative, 
		they are a chloropleth map, polar coordinates, and a line graph. But to
		have all of them synced up is definitely creative because it recreates 
		the simple and well known with a new interactive twist.

	Does the visualization scale to the used dataset? Could it handle larger but
	similar datasets?
		It can definitely handle datasets of any size and breadth. We have taken
		careful precautions to make sure that it could be scaled, thus making it 
		easier to make modifications down the road


Visual Encoding

	Does the visualization follow the principles used in class? 
		Yes, the design avoids clutter and confusions in its current state, 
		these are not elements of information but rather elements of failure. 
		We are happy that others think likewise. The design is functional and 
		its functionality is translated into its visual aesthetics without 
		needing an explanation. We maintain visual integrity and do not stray
		from proper scales. We focus on position the most and take angle and
		saturation into account as well so far. Down the road we will also bring
		length into the equation, and possibly area.

	What is the primary visual encoding? Does it match to the most important 
	aspect of the data?
		The Primary visual encoding is the linked-Line Graph. This syncs up with
		the chloropleth map and the parallel coordinates. It shows a time graph
		but could be better worked considering there are five indicators of 
		display. We hope to solve this problem with a tooltip "stats at a glance"
		The most important thing we are looking at is difference in indicator 
		over time, and that is what the line graph gives us. The map only gives
		us a view of one variable for all 50 states. The parallel coordinates
		are best used for brushing our data down into the categories we want

	What other visual variables are used? Are they effective?
		The other variables in use are parallel coordinates, a chloropleth map,
		and a tooltip that navigates all of the variables. The whole feel is 
		very connected.

	Is color sensibly used? If not, suggest improvements.
		Color could be better used. We are only using one main color scheme right 
		now, ideally we would move to a five pronged approach-one for each 
		indicator. This is not a top priority for our first Milestone, but will
		be set to go coming into the final week of the project.


Interaction and Animation
	Is the interaction meaningful? If not, suggest improvements.
		The interaction is meaningful but our partners are thinking that the data
		could be better. So we will look into other possible data sets for the 
		final deadline push. It would also be ideal to have the graph tooltip 
		that we had talked about as a group, which would add more interactivity
		of the intuitive type. It would be great to have a tutorial interface as
		well.

	If multiple views, are they coordinated? If not, would it be meaningful?
		There are multiple views and the transitions with the line graph 
		especially flow very nicely with the interaction with the rest. With 
		this as our major interactor we were happy to hear this.

	Is there any animation planned? Is it clear? Is it intuitive? 
		Yes, there is animation in the process, but first we need to add year 
		selectors of some sort. Another thing that we will have fixed in the 
		coming week or two. Ideally we will get a movement across the ten years
		with noticeable changes to the parallel coordinates and map.
